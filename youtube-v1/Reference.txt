Naming Conventions
---

Casing Types 
==========
  1. PascalCase 
      * recommended for Object Oriented Program's (Java, JS & TS) classes 
      * also recommended for Interface in Java & TypeScript 

      examples:
        class CarDetails{

        }

        interface Employee{

        }

  2. camelCase
      * recommended for variables, const, functions, methods in JS & TS 
      * recommended for id's of html elements 

      examples: 
        var myCar = 'BMW'; 
        function getCarInfo() {
          // .... 
        }

  3. kebab-case 
      * recommended for css classes 
      * recommended for urls 
      * recommended for file names, folder names, assets in front end       projects 
      * okay for id's of html elements if your architect accepts

      Examples:
      --
        btn-primary 
        slideshow-container 
        youtube-logo.png 

  4. snake_case 
      * never ever use this.
      * okay for const in JS & TS if architect accepts 

      example:
      ---
        const MAX_STUDENTS_PER_CLASS = 30;
