2 Types of NPM Dependencies 
-------
1. Project Dependencies
		* packages are needed for the functionality of the project to work

		npm i react 
		npm i dropzone 
		npm i bootstrap 

2. Development Dependencies
		* packages are needed for the project to be developed 

		npm i typescript --save-dev 
		npm i typescript -D 

		npm i sass -D 

====
Naming Conventions
---
	PascalCase
	--------
			* Folder of Components, Component File names and Component Names 


Components 
---
1. Functional Components [ RECOMMENDED ]
		* coded with functions 
		* were called as Presentational Components, Dumb Components (before 2019) 
		* were called as Stateless Components (before 2019 - till react v 16.8) 

		1.1. Functional Component with Named Function [DONE]
		1.2. Functional Component with Anonymous Function [DONE]
		1.3. Functional Component with Arrow Function [DONE] [RECOMMENDED]

2. Class Components 
		* coded as classes 
		* a.k.a Containers, Smart Components, Stateful Components 
		* will have life cycle hooks

Limitations of JSX 
--
	1. all tags should be closed 
	2. href should be with valid value 
	3. JSX expressions must have one parent element.
	4. class should become className 
	5. style should have mapping to obj -- not string

The top level directory structure will be as follows:

	assets - global static assets such as images, svgs, company logo, etc.
	components - global shared/reusable components, such as layout (wrappers, navigation), form components, buttons
	services - JavaScript modules
	store - Global Redux store
	utils - Utilities, helpers, constants, and the like
	pages - Can also be called "views", the majority of the app would be contained here

Building SPA using React-router-dom 
---
	Step 1:
	---
		npm i react-router-dom

	Step 2: 
	--
		Let's identify the URLs of our project 

		Home 				localhost:3000/     
		About us	 	localhost:3000/about     
		Contact us	localhost:3000/contact-us 

		Let's make the necessary changes in MenuList Comp 
	
	Step 3: 
	----
		Identify the matching components for the URLs

		localhost:3000/    						-- HomePage Component 
		localhost:3000/about    			-- AboutPage Component
		localhost:3000/contact-us    	-- ContactUsPage Component

		If any of the above components not created yet, create now 

		src/
			pagess/
				AboutPage/
					AboutPage.js 
				ContactUsPage/
					ContactUsPage.js 

	Step 4: 
	---
		Configure the URLs in App.js 

		Let's put the whole component under the control of BrowserRouter of react-router-dom 

		and then complete the route configs 
			 <Routes>
				{/* URL configuration */}
				<Route path="/" element={<HomePage />} />
				<Route path="/about" element={<AboutPage />} />
				<Route path="/contact-us" element={<ContactUsPage />} />
			</Routes>

	Step 5: 
	---
		Pages are still reloading/refreshing. Let's fix 

		in MenuList.js replace all <a href=''> with <Link to=''>
